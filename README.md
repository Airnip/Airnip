We are Andras Hazai and Istvan Sajtos, the founders of the Hungarian start-up, Airnip. Colleagues for many years, we both come from an agency and IT background. 
 
We, at Airnip know exactly how chaotic and disorganised agency workflows can be. It is a familiar situation to all of us running ad agencies, consulting firms, architect offices, dealing with complex tasks and resources, projects billed in work hours. We are agency folks and have experienced how frustrating management can get. Too often, work flows end up being a mess, difficult to manage and nearly impossible to measure the work’s efficiency and productivity. There isn't a workflow management software out there sophisticated enough to make workflows transparent, plannable and one which channels all tasks into one surface. 
 
We wanted to change this. Our goal was clear: To create a solution for the agency community. To get rid of messy workflows, make decision making easier and more reliable, and the work more productive and measurable. So we founded Airnip in 2020 and with seed money from venture capital fund Solus Capital we have recently introduced its public beta version. 

By designing Airnip, we created an innovative software to achieve this goal. A workflow management software created by agency people for agencies, or any other company that bills in work hours and needs to improve its work flow.
 
All tasks channelled to one surface 
Softwares do exist for separate parts of the workflow but one that handles each part of it does not. There are plenty of softwares to register work hours, Excel is great for expenses planning, invoices can be made in an invoicing program, quotes created in Google Sheets, PDF Word or Google Sheet. The market lacks a software that has it all. Airnip was developed for this reason. 
 
Some of the modules of Airnip you will love:
 
Dashboard
The Dashboard module allows you to have a complete overview of the project’s health. Whether the project is on/off track. Moreover, it sends alerts for deadlines, milestones, capacity and workload and shows ongoing project views.  
 
Brief 
We collected and included a wide range of brief templates designed by industry experts. In case none of the templates work for you, you can also design your own within Airnip. 
 
Quote
With Airnip, preparing a quote is made easy. Not only can team members register hour estimates, contractors can also send offers within Airnip. If the default template does not fit your needs, the feel and look of the quote can be customised as well. 
 
Roadmap and Capacity - The heart and Soul of Airnip
We had to face it: the currently available softwares on the market are way too rigid when it comes to capacity planning. They cater to an idealistic world and are not able to adapt to real life situations. This makes capacity planning unreliable, which is annoying. The market definitely needed an upgrade and we made it happen by developing Airnip. One of Airnip’s innovations lies in how flexible its capacity planning function is. Its Roadmap and Capacity module adapts to real life situations e.g. sudden change in resources and updates the workflow accordingly thus providing reliable data. It helps in finding teammates with available capacity, plans team workload, assigns team members and contractors to projects. Evenmore, it compares task estimates with actual logs and shows recommended teammates for tasks based on skills and availability. Another exciting innovation of the module lies in how the capacity planning and resource management functions communicate with each other.  When you make a change in capacity planning Airnip makes the change in resource management accordingly, and vice versa. This makes Airnip the most reliable workflow management tool on the market. 
 
Monitor Projects
This module shows you whether teammates are under-, or overloaded, what the status of their task is. It sends alerts on project deadlines and gives direct access to quotes, briefs and the project's timeline.
 
Clear and Simple Interface
We wanted to create a simple, yet sophisticated interface. Spare you from data unrelated to workflow management and irrelevant to measure the work’s productivity. We created a clear and simple interface that you will love.
